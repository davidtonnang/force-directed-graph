Whether it's a 5 year-old child or a 95 year-old elderly, Albus Home can be used with anyone, anywhere and as long as needed. This helps collect continuous and objective evidence from participants' homes in clinical trials without needing clinical visits. In healthcare, it provides exciting opportunities for continuous monitoring of a range of chronic conditions to provide a diagnosis as well as early warning signs of worsening several days prior to an emergency, so patients can stay healthy at home."
